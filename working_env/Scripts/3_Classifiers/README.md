simple_classification : Classification with decision tree and adjacency matrix

n2v_dtc : Classification with decision tree and node2vec representation, you have to choose manually hyperparameters

n2v_nn : Classification with neural network and node2vec representation, you have to choose manually hyperparameters

n2v_nn_opt: Classification with neural network and node2vec representation, you have to set a range in which yours hyperparameters will be searched. 
At the end of the execution, you will obtain the best hyperparameters in your range.
